This repository contains analyzer code for LArSoft based off of Roberto Soleti's 
analyzer code found here: https://github.com/soleti/1e1pFilter. The analyzer code
is contained within /1e1pFilter.

The code used for processing the analyzer output, including computing reconstructed
shower containment within the TPC volume and for generating metrics for an ensemble
of shower selections, can be found in ShowerProcessing.C
